# Project: Custom Subnet Creation


## Project Overview

This project aims to create a custom virtual machine using the HyperSDK framework to facilitate minting and transferring tokens. It enables users to build a tailored blockchain solution that supports token creation, asset transfer, and trading via order books.

The goal is to provide a streamlined process for developers looking to implement blockchain features into their applications, leveraging the power of HyperSDK for scalability and customization.


## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed before proceeding:

1. **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**:  
   - This project is developed using Ubuntu on WSL.
   
2. **Go Programming Language**:  
   - Install Go using the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo snap install go --classic
     ```
   - Verify the installation:
     ```bash
     go version
     ```

3. **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**:  
   - Install GCC on WSL:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install build-essential
     ```
   - Verify the installation:
     ```bash
     gcc --version
     ```

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jasrotia15/Create-a-Custom-Subnet.git
   ```

2. **Open the repository in VS Code**:
   - From the Ubuntu terminal, run:
     ```bash
     code .
     ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   - Open a terminal in VS Code and run:
     ```bash
     go mod tidy
     ```

4. **Ensure Go is in your system PATH**:
   - Run:
     ```bash
     export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
     ```
   - If this doesnâ€™t work, try:
     ```bash
     export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
     ```

## Running the Project

1. **Launch the Subnet**:
   ```bash
   MODE="run-single" ./scripts/run.sh
   ```
   > **Note**: This process may take a few minutes.

2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh
   ```
   - The compiled CLI will be available at `./build/token-cli`.

3. **Import the demo private key**:
   ```bash
   ./build/token-cli key import demo.pk
   ./build/token-cli chain import-anr
   ```

4. **Interact with the HyperChain**:

   - **Create an asset**:
     ```bash
     ./build/token-cli action create-asset
     ```
   - **Mint your asset**:
     ```bash
     ./build/token-cli action mint-asset
     ```
   - **View account balance**:
     ```bash
     ./build/token-cli key balance
     ```
   - **Transfer tokens**:
     ```bash
     ./build/token-cli action transfer
     ```
   - **Create an order**:
     ```bash
     ./build/token-cli action create-order
     ```
   - **Fill an order**:
     ```bash
     ./build/token-cli action fill-order
     ```
   - **Close an order**:
     ```bash
     ./build/token-cli action close-order
     ```

## Troubleshooting


## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter while running the project and how to resolve them:

1. **Issue**: Go command not recognized.  
   **Solution**: Ensure that Go is properly installed and that the correct PATH is set. Run:
   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
   ```

2. **Issue**: Network issues when launching the subnet.  
   **Solution**: Check that all necessary dependencies are installed, and ensure no conflicting processes are running. Try stopping all processes:
   ```bash
   killall avalanche-network-runner
   ```

3. **Issue**: Build script fails.  
   **Solution**: Make sure all dependencies are installed by running:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```


## Monitoring On-Chain Activity

Watch real-time on-chain activity by running:
```bash
./build/token-cli chain watch
```
